# COVID-19 Vaccine Waste Tracker
Team: Sreya Katabathuni, Rae Mathews, Elaina Phalen, Gabe Vordick

## The purpose and inspiration:
What drove you to build what you built? Whether you created something to solve a problem, or just for fun, judges like to know why. 
We wanted to create a tool to help hospitals and other COVID-19 vaccine distribution centers to record and report vaccines that are wasted. The CDC reports
that many vaccines are going to waste, but there is no concerted effort to track all of this waste.

## The product itself:
What did you actually create? Demonstrate what your project does, and how it works. This is your time to shine, so don’t hesitate to show off the parts you are proud of.
We built a dashboard to display wasted vaccines over time and by location. Hospitals and distribution centers can also report their wasted vaccines. One way this dashboard is useful is that it can help legislators make informed decisions about vaccine distribution.

## The process:
Your hackathon experience doesn’t just revolve around the final version of your project prototype, so it’s important to show your working process throughout the weekend. What challenges did you face and how did you overcome them? Did your project idea change and evolve as you were working?
Our original idea was to create a dashboard as well as connect patients with surplus vaccines before they went to waste. However, we quickly realized that we would not have time to implement both sides, so we chose to focus on the administrative side. Seemed much more manageable so we went on to build a React frontend, a Spring boot API, and a MySQL database.


## Challenges we ran into: 
- None of our team members have ever built anything like this before
- The initial idea was too big to implement so we went through various stages of restructuring
- Physical storage limitations
- Every member worked with a framework/technology that they were not familiar with before this weekend
- The problem we are solving is due to the lack of data, so we didn't have realistic data to go off of

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Having something to show at the end
- The database updates when a user enter data
- Connecting our frontend, backend, and database
- Working well with new people

## What did you learn?:
Hopefully, you learned a lot of things this weekend! Did you try a new skill or improve on something you don’t have much experience with? Maybe you did some design for the first time, or worked with people you haven’t met before! Judges like to see when you’ve stepped out of your comfort zone.
- New frameworks/tech (Spring boot, React, MySQL)
- Gained insight into full stack development
- Using Git/GitHub with multiple branches!
- Project ideation, formation, and management

## What’s next for your project?
Is there anything else you wish you had time to add to your project? How could you improve on your project in the future?
There are definitely a lot of features we would have loved to implement with more time. Tracking which types of vaccines were wasted, creating a way for hospitals to log vaccines that are about to expire to connect to a public facing notification system where people can sign up to receive vaccines that would otherwise go bad, more ways to display the data (in a map, adding different filter metrics to the graph and table), and hosting the dashboard publicly.
