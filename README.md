# COVID-19 Vaccine Waste Tracker
Team: Sreya Katabathuni, Rae Mathews, Elaina Phalen, Gabe Vordick

## The purpose and inspiration:
We wanted to create a tool to help hospitals and other COVID-19 vaccine distribution centers to record and report vaccines that are wasted. The CDC reports
that many vaccines are going to waste, but there is no concerted effort to track all of this waste.

## The product itself:
We built a dashboard to display wasted vaccines over time and by location. Hospitals and distribution centers can also report their wasted vaccines. One way this dashboard is useful is that it can help legislators make informed decisions about vaccine distribution.

## The process:
Our original idea was to create a dashboard as well as connect patients with surplus vaccines before they went to waste. However, we quickly realized that we would not have time to implement both sides, so we chose to focus on the administrative side. Seemed much more manageable so we went on to build a React frontend, a Spring boot API, and a MySQL database.

## Challenges we ran into: 
- None of our team members have ever built anything like this before
- The initial idea was too big to implement so we went through various stages of restructuring
- Every member worked with a framework/technology that they were not familiar with before this weekend
- The problem we are solving is due to the lack of data, so we didn't have realistic data to go off of

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
- Having something to show at the end
- The database updates when a user enters data
- Connecting our frontend, backend, and database
- Working well with new people

## What did you learn?:
- New frameworks/tech (Spring boot, React, MySQL)
- Gained insight into full stack development
- Using Git/GitHub with multiple branches
- Project ideation, formation, and management

## Whatâ€™s next for your project?
There are definitely a lot of features we would have loved to implement with more time. Tracking which types of vaccines were wasted, creating a way for hospitals to log vaccines that are about to expire to connect to a public facing notification system where people can sign up to receive vaccines that would otherwise go bad, more ways to display the data (in a map, adding different filter metrics to the graph and table), and hosting the dashboard publicly.
